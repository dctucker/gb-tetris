This is a table for controlling the disassembly of tetris for use with the GBDis V1.3 disassembler or later. This table is to the point that the disassembled code now resembles the original source code minus the original comments. You can move routines around and it will still compile to a working game. Commenting the source code is laborious and is a slow process. NOTE: You must already have the game tetris for GB on disk in order to use this file.
